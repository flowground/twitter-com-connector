Given a latitude and a longitude pair, an IP address, or a name, this\nrequest will return a list of all the valid places that can be used as the place_id when updating a\nstatus.\n\nConceptually, a query can be made from the user's location, retrieve a list of places, have the user\nvalidate the location he or she is at, and then send the ID of this location with a call to POST\nstatuses/update.\n\nThis is the recommended method to use find places that can be attached to statuses/update. Unlike\nGET geo/reverse_geocode which provides raw data access, this endpoint can potentially re-order\nplaces with regards to the user who is authenticated. This approach is also preferred for\ninteractive place matching with the user.",
